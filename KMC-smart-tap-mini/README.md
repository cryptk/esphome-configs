These are ESPHome configs for the KCM Smart Tap Mini with the bk72xx/CB2S wifi module.

basic.yaml: A fairly minimal example that results in a functional device

full.yaml: A more feature-rich configuration that supports the following:
- Toggle outlets with the built-in button via single/double/triple clicks to toggle outlets 1/2/3
- Restart the device by holding the button for 5 seconds
- Factory reset the device by holding the button for at least 10 seconds
- Web portal enabled for device control
